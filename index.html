        <p>Every time I think of you, I feel a soft wave of gratitude.<br>
        For the kindness in your words, the moments we shared,<br>
        and even for the silence between us.<br>
        It's all been meaningful in its own way.<br>
        Grateful for every piece of you that's crossed my path.</p>

        <h3><span class="title-content">Grateful for Quiet Moments</span> <span class="emoji">🌸</span></h3>
        <p>It's in the little, unspoken moments that I feel most thankful.<br>
        Like when I see something that reminds me of you, and for a second,<br>
        I can't help but smile.<br>
        It's not loud or demanding — just a quiet recognition that<br>
        I'm grateful for your presence in my thoughts, even from afar.</p>

        <h3><span class="title-content">I Didn't Know Where to Put This</span> <span class="emoji">💫</span></h3>
        <p>So I placed it here.<br>
        Not in your inbox. Not on your feed.<br>
        But in a quiet, out-of-the-way place — where it wouldn't ask anything from you, except maybe a pause.<br>
        Some feelings don't fit into conversations, only corners.</p>

      <article class="letter-card">
        <h3><span class="title-content">Thankful for You, Even from a Distance</span> <span class="emoji">🌿</span></h3>
        <p>I don't need to see you to feel the warmth of your spirit.<br>
        I'm grateful for the quiet strength you've shown,<br>
        and for the way you've made my days better, even when you're not around.<br>
        It's a quiet kind of gratitude, one that doesn't ask for anything<br>
        but is still filled with all the good things you've given without even knowing it.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="letter-card">
        <h3><span class="title-content">In the Small Things</span> <span class="emoji">🌱</span></h3>
        <p>I've learned to appreciate the little things — the unspoken kindness,<br>
        the quiet gestures that don't need recognition.<br>
        Like the way your presence lingers even when you're not near.<br>
        It's in these small moments, these quiet acts, that I find my deepest gratitude.</p>

      <article class="letter-card">
        <h3><span class="title-content">A Soft Thank You</span> <span class="emoji">🌺</span></h3>
        <p>Thank you for simply being,<br>
        for showing up as you are,<br>
        for the quiet strength and honesty you bring into my life.<br>
        This isn't a thank you that demands anything in return,<br>
        but just a soft acknowledgment that I see you,<br>
        and I'm grateful for everything you are.</p>
